 *  Example of Class Declaration
 * 1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will 
 *    encounter later.
 * 2. The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
 * 3. The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the 
 *    keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
 * 4. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, 
 *    preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one 
 *    interface.
The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.
